                    <p>
                        Welcome to JadyTrack.com, the website and online service of JadyTrack, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the JadyTrack Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service (“Users”).
                        <br><br>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.  BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU INDICATE YOUR CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

                        <br><br>1. Use of the Service

                        <br><br>A. Eligibility

                        <br>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Company, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited from creating an account for the Service. In addition, anyone under 13 may only accept invitations from parents / legal guardians to join their account.

                        <br><br>B. Service Rules

                        <br>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.

                        <br><br>C.  License to Use the Service

                        <br>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service.

You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Company will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

                        <br>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing settings that are made available to you.

                        <br><br>2. Service Availability and Our Right to Terminate

                        <br>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement. You are responsible for all the mobile data usage resulting from the use of Service. Consult your mobile operator concerning your plan, data rate charges and limits. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.

                        <br><br>3. User Content

                        <br>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such content a User submits, posts, displays, creates, or affirmatively chooses to make available on the Service is “User Content”). User Content does not include information about your phone or device.  We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to the User Content License Grant below, and to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. Company has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.

                        <br>You agree not to post or transmit User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current; (ix) violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics; (x) interferes with other Users of the Service including, without limitation, disrupting the normal flow of dialogue in an interactive area of the Service and deleting or revising any content posted by another person or entity; (xi) except where expressly permitted, post or transmit charity requests, petitions for signatures, franchise arrangements, distributorship arrangements, sales representative agency arrangements or other business opportunities (including offers of employment or contracting arrangements), club memberships, chain letters or letters relating to pyramid schemes, any advertising or promotional materials or any other solicitation of other users to use goods or services except in those areas (e.g., a classified bulletin board) that are designated for such purpose. You agree that any employment or other relationship you form or attempt to form with an employer, employee, or contractor whom you contact through areas of the Service that may be designated for that purpose is between you and that employer, employee, or contractor alone, and not with us. You may not copy or use personal identifying or business contact information about other Users without their permission. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. Company reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Company believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.

                        <br>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.

                        <br>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:

                        <br>A. You have the consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.

                        <br>B. Your User Content and Company’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights. Company takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Company shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.

                        <br><br>4. User Content License Grant

                        <br>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Company a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and for our commercial, marketing, advertising, and other purposes.

                        <br><br>5. Mobile Software

                        <br><br>A. Mobile Software.

                        <br>As part of the Service, we make available software and/or applications designed for mobile devices (“Mobile Software”). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Software. Company does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. Company hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one Company account owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software. You acknowledge that Company may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device.

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and Company or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Mobile Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Mobile Software by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions set forth in this Agreement and as provided in DFARS 227.7202-1(a) and 227.7202-3(a) (1995), DFARS 252.227-7013(c)(1)(ii) (OCT 1988), FAR 12.212(a) (1995), FAR 52.227-19, or FAR 52.227-14 (ALT III), as applicable. The Mobile Software originates in the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Software may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Software may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Software and the Company Service.

                        <br><br>B.  Mobile Software from iTunes.

                        <br>The following applies to any Mobile Software you acquire from the iTunes Store (“iTunes-Sourced Software”): You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is solely between you and Company, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the iTunes-Sourced Software or content thereof. Your use of the iTunes-Sourced Software must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software. In the event of any failure of the iTunes-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the iTunes-Sourced Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to Company as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use of the iTunes-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to Company as provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that iTunes-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Company, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and Company acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

                        <br><br>6.  Our Communications With You

                        <br>By providing Company your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive promotional email messages, you may opt out by unsubscribing from such email communications from Company. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

                        <br><br>7. Our Proprietary Rights

                        <br>Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials and information therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, information about your phone or device, or data that is otherwise generated, collected or transmitted through use of the Service or Mobile Software, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content belonging to other Users (the “Company Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Company and its licensors (including other Users who post User Content to the Service).

Use of the Company Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.

                        <br>You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Company under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Company does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Company, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

                        <br><br>8. Features of the Service

                        <br>The Service includes a number of features which may or may not be available to you depending on which features you elect and, where required, pay or subscribe to use.  Some of the Service features require Mobile Software to be installed on the devices that the features apply to.  This section identifies some of the types of features that are part of the Service, and that may be available for you to use or pay or subscribe to use, along with important information about those features.

                        <br><br>A. 24/7 Live Advisor.

                        <br><br>C. Location Information Features.

                        <br>There are features that are designed to collect and share location information, about you and other individuals who use the Service.  These features require the corresponding Mobile Software to be installed on the device for which location data will be provided, and the features may not work if the corresponding settings to allow the collection and sharing of information and location information are not enabled.  In addition, the features may not work for a variety of reasons, such as if the device that the Mobile Software is installed on is not powered on and connected to the wireless service provider’s network (e.g., it will not work if the phone is connected to a wi-fi network), if location services are turned off, if the Service is not being used or is blocked on the device, etc.

                        <br>If you use features designed to collect and share location information, the Service will periodically access and collect information about your device and location (such information will be Company Content under this Agreement).  By using the features designed to collect and share information, you represent and warrant that you have consented, to use the service and to allow it to access and collect such information.

Please do not use the driver protection features in a way that distracts you while driving, or that interferes with your ability to follow traffic laws.

                        <br>The driver protection features will periodically access and collect information about your phone and driving activity that can be detected by the phone, including your location, the use and movement of the phone, the speed of your motor vehicle, etc. (such information will be Company Content under this Agreement).  The driver protection features may collect this information for any motor vehicle that you are in, even if you are not the driver.  If you do not have permission from the driver to collect this information, please be sure to deactivate the driver protection features.  By using the driver protection features in a motor vehicle, you represent and warrant that you are the driver and have consented, or that have obtained consent from the driver, to use the driver protection features and to allow them to access and collect such information.

                        <br>When you use driver protection features and the corresponding Mobile Software is installed on your phone, the features may help to detect automobile crashes when you are in an automobile and your phone is with you.  Up to six (6) devices can be used per JadyTrack paid subscription. Your phone must be powered on and properly functioning for the driver protection features to work.  If a crash is detected, the driver protection features may prompt you to determine whether you need assistance, and it may utilize your phone to communicate with or call a Company call center or 911 center to help you seek assistance.  The driver protection features will collect your precise location information, and in the event of a potential crash, it may transmit that and other information to Company (e.g., a Company call center), third party service providers acting on behalf of Company, and/or to a 911 center or other emergency response professionals (e.g., police, fire department, paramedics, etc.).  By using or subscribing to the driver protection features, you expressly consent to allow Company or the Service to contact you or your phone by push notification, text message, or call, including through use of an automatic telephone dialing system, including in connection with the Driver Protect service and/or crash detection.

                        <br>While the driver protection features are designed to help you in the event of an automobile crash, it may not detect all crashes or be able to communicate with Company or a 911 center in the event of a crash.  For example, the driver protection features may be able to detect a particular crash, hardware limitations may prevent crash detection, limitations or errors in the algorithms and processes used by Driver Protect may not function properly (including, without limitation, if the automobile is moving at a slow speed, or is stopped at the time of a crash), and crashes may not be detected if you are located outside of your wireless service coverage area for the phone that the Mobile Software for the driver protection features is installed on or if your phone is otherwise not connected to your wireless service provider’s network (e.g., it will not work if the phone is connected to a wi-fi network).  Other factors also may prevent accurate crash detection.  The driver protection features are NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR 911 in the event of a serious crash, or one that involves an injury.  In the event of such a crash, always dial 911 immediately. Calls may be monitored and recorded for quality assurance purposes.

                        <br>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Company, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.

                        <br><br>B. Arbitration.

                        <br>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY.

The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Company’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

                        <br><br>16. General

                        <br><br>A. Assignment.
